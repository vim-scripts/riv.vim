  Vim. Or, you can read "`Quick reStructuredText`_".

to Riv are welcome too. 

You can follow my twitter `@rykkaf`_ and notice me there too.

Common Issues
-------------

* If you get errors with folding in documents, you can try to force reload
  using ``:RivReload`` or ``<C-E>t```.

  Or just `:w` as it will auto refolding after saving.

* Windows:
  
  - Converting to other formats may fail. 
    
    This could happen due to Docutils not working correctly with
    ``vimrun.exe``.

* Mac OS:

  - Lists don't act as expected.
  
    This could happen if the ``<C-Enter>`` key could not be mapped. Try some
    other mapping instead.
